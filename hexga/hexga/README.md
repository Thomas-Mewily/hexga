ðŸš§ **Warning: Experimental Crate!** ðŸš§

This crate is currently in **beta** and **experimental**.  
It is subject to **breaking changes** in future releases.  
Use it at your own risk, and keep in mind that the API may change in future versions.


HexGa is the crate that includes all other HexGa-related console crates (except the multimedia crate).
It is still possible to include each crate manually for more granularity, but using this one is easier and quicker.

To get started quickly, just use:

```rust
use hexga::prelude::*;
```


HexGa (LibOur) stand for

- **H**ighly **E**xtensible **G**eneral **A**pplication **L**ib **O**ur
- **H**ighly **E**xtensible **GA**me **L**ib **O**ur

(Depending of the context)
The name was inspired by Excalibur, the sword.
