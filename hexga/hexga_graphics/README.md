## HexGa Graphics

Currently don't do that much, can just create a image from a grid and save it.


```rust
use hexga_graphics::prelude::*;

assert_eq!(<ColorRGBAOf::<u8> as CastRangeIntoComposite<u16>>::cast_range_into_composite(ColorRGBAOf::<u8>::RED),
            ColorRGBAOf::<u16>::RED
          );
```

### More advanced type

If you need more control about the precision, each type have another more generic base type:

- `ColorRGBA` and `ColorHSLA` also use a `float` precision that can be changed using `ColorRGBAOf` and `ColorRGBAOf`
