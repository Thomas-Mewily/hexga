ðŸš§ **Warning: Experimental Crate!** ðŸš§

This crate is currently in **beta** and **experimental**.  
It is subject to **breaking changes** in future releases.  
Use it at your own risk, and keep in mind that the API may change in future versions.

## Toolings & Nightly

HexGa currently use nightly to have access to the `get_disjoint_mut_helpers` : [GetDisjointMutIndex trait from the slice::get_disjoint_mut()](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html#method.get_disjoint_mut)

HexGa is **heavily trait-based**. For the best development experience, use the **latest version of Rust Analyzer** (the preview version on VS Code for example), which currently features the new trait solver. This makes autocompletion much faster.

(Depending of the context)
The name was inspired by Excalibur, the sword.

Currently, HexGa is the continuation/start from scratch from a [school project](https://gitlab.isima.fr/thtamagnau/zz3_interpreter), as well as my personnal set of crate to do common task that I started way before the school project.
