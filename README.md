🚧 **Warning: Experimental Crates!** 🚧

Theses crates are currently in **beta** and **experimental**.
They are subject to **breaking changes** in future releases.
Use them at your own risk, and keep in mind that the API may change in future versions.

## Design

HexGa is **heavily trait-based**.

If you use Rust Analyzer, it’s recommended to increase certain settings for better performance and completions, especially:
- `rust-analyzer.assist.termSearch.fuel`
- `rust-analyzer.completion.termSearch.fuel`
for a better experience.

## HexGa

HexGa is a set of crate to solve mutliple problem of different kind (mathematic, bitflags)...

To get started quickly, just do in a terminal :

```bash
cargo add hexga
```

then in your rust project :

```rust
use hexga::prelude::*;
```




HexGa (LibOur) stand for

- **H**ighly **E**xtensible **G**eneral **A**pplication **L**ib **O**ur

or

- **H**ighly **E**xtensible **GA**me **L**ib **O**ur


(Depending of the context)
The name was inspired by Excalibur, the sword.

Currently, HexGa is the continuation/start from scratch from a [school project](https://gitlab.isima.fr/thtamagnau/zz3_interpreter), as well as my personnal set of crate to do common task that I started way before the school project.
